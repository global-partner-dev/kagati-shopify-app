/**
 * Function to execute the global action for processing payment link status.
 * 
 * This function is intended to be used as a global action within the Gadget server environment.
 * It takes the context object as a parameter, which provides access to various resources needed
 * for the execution of this action, such as API methods, logging functionality, and other connections.
 * 
 * @param {PaymentLinkStatusGlobalActionContext} context - The context object containing parameters and resources
 * for executing the global action. The context includes:
 * 
 * @param {Object} context.params - Parameters passed to the global action. 
 *                                   This usually includes any data or arguments required by the action.
 * 
 * @param {Object} context.logger - Logger object that can be used to log information, warnings, errors, etc.,
 *                                   during the execution of the action.
 * 
 * @param {Object} context.api - API object that provides methods for interacting with the Gadget server's backend services,
 *                                such as making database queries, mutations, or other server-side operations.
 * 
 * @param {Object} context.connections - Connections object that can be used to interact with other services or databases
 *                                        connected to the Gadget server.
 * 
 * @returns {Promise<void>} - The function is asynchronous and returns a Promise. The function's logic should handle
 *                            any asynchronous operations, such as API calls, within its implementation.
 * 
 * @example
 * // Example usage of the run function:
 * await run({
 *   params: { id: "12345", status: "active" },
 *   logger: console,
 *   api: gadgetApi,
 *   connections: someDatabaseConnection
 * });
 * 
 * // The actual logic of this action should be implemented within the function body.
