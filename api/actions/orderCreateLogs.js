/**
 * Function to execute the global action for creating logs related to order creation.
 * 
 * This function is designed to be used as a global action within the Gadget server environment. 
 * It handles logging information related to the creation of an order. The specifics of the logging 
 * process should be implemented within the function body, utilizing the resources provided by the context.
 * 
 * @param {OrderCreateLogsGlobalActionContext} context - The context object containing parameters and resources
 * for executing the global action. The context includes:
 * 
 * @param {Object} context.params - Parameters passed to the global action, which may include details 
 * related to the order that was created, such as the order ID, customer information, and any other relevant data.
 * 
 * @param {Object} context.logger - Logger object that can be used to log information, warnings, errors, etc.,
 * during the execution of the action. This will be crucial for recording logs related to the order creation process.
 * 
 * @param {Object} context.api - API object that provides methods for interacting with the Gadget server's backend services,
 * including making database queries, mutations, or other server-side operations as part of the logging process.
 * 
 * @param {Object} context.connections - Connections object that can be used to interact with other services or databases
 * connected to the Gadget server, if needed.
 * 
 * @returns {Promise<void>} - The function is asynchronous and returns a Promise. The function's logic should handle
 * any asynchronous operations, such as API calls, within its implementation.
 * 
 * @example
 * // Example usage of the run function:
 * await run({
 *   params: { orderId: "12345", customerId: "cust67890" },
 *   logger: console,
 *   api: gadgetApi,
 *   connections: someDatabaseConnection
 * });
 * 
 * // The actual logic of this action should be implemented within the function body.
